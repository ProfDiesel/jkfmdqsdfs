    Tooling:



Carry on ContextProvider:


# Intro:
- Among apes, Humans are the ones who craft/keep their tools. How not to be a code monkey ?

# Reminder on LLM
===
- need a context

# RAG
===
- encoding from text to its representation, and decode back, through the prims/filter of its training data
- unbalanced pair programming 
- working with dogs
- Pushing context explicitely

# diagram


## demo
_Not using the shortcuts: not compatible with Vim keystrokes. Till now, too lazy to define some_

## implementation
_I don't know TS. Like Dutch to me. I know German and a little English, so I can read the ingredient list at the back of my cereal box while having breakfast._
_Greenfield project to try my hand on pair-prog with an LLM, 4 hands_


# Tools and ReAct
===
Down the Rabbit hole.
_No "now what ?" moment with an LLM. Urgence to talk. Verbal diarhea._

# diagram
_Grey parrot_


# No prompt coding:
===
- too lazy to prompt => paste code, let it fill the gap


# QA
===
_otherwise I'll fill the gap from whatever I'm fancy coming from my training data. I've talked to LLMs to much lately._
